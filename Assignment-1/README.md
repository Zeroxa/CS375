#Assignment-1

I searched term "WebGL experiments" on google, I found one interesting WebGL website, it's called Blobmixer https://blobmixer.14islands.com/
On this site, you can create a coloful 3D blob or "art" like what they advertised, and own it as a video or view it in VR.
You can also submit your work to their NFT collection, and profits from those NFT will be donated to charity.
